## Install Dependencies
Go to the directory containing requirements.txt 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup Database
For this project, we are using Django's default database setup i.e., SQLite. However, it is recommended to use a more robust setup.
```python
DATABASES = {
    "default": {
        "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.sqlite3",
        "NAME": BASE_DIR / "db.sqlite3",
    }
}
```
Note: Different Databases require different setups. Please setup your database accordingly.

To create the necessary database tables and prepare your database, run the following commands in your terminal:
```python
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

To access the Django admin interface, you'll need to create a superuser:
```python
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

## Run the program
After installing the dependencies and setting up the database you should be good to go and execute the program.  
Make sure you are in the directory containing the manage.py file and Run the following command line to bring up the server 
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
If everything went smoothly, you should see the below screen.

Account Maintenance:

Users can view their existing accounts or request the deletion of an account.

All transactions are initially marked as pending and are completed only upon approval by authorized personnel, such as bank employees or managers.
